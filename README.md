# SFTPGo SDK

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/sftpgo/sdk.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sftpgo/sdk)

The SFTPGo SDK contains code useful for developing SFTPGo plugins.

Although we try not to break functionality, we reserve the right to reorganize the code at will and may occasionally cause breaks if they are warranted. As such we expect the tag of this module will stay less than `v1.0.0`.
